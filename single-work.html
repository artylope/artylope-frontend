          <h2>The Problem</h2>
          <p>
            In Singapore, when motorists park their vehicles in public car parks, they have to tear pre-paid paper coupons to pay for parking. This is cumbersome for the users. They need to stock up coupons and tear many pieces if they were to park for a long period of time. If they want to extend parking, they will have to run back to their vehicle to tear more coupons.
          </p>
          <p>
            We wanted to develop a digital parking system that can replace paper coupons. This solution must also integrate with the existing parking enforcement infrastructure.
          </p>

          <h2>The Solution</h2>
          <p>
            In October 2017, we launched Parking.sg a mobile app that allows motorists in Singapore pay for parking charges using their mobile phones at all coupon-based public car parks.
          </p>
